# Introduction
This program is a unit converter that allows the user to convert between different units of length, weight, and temperature.
#
The program starts by displaying a welcome message and a menu of unit types to choose from. The user inputs their choice using the cin statement.
#
If the user selects length, they are prompted to enter a value in meters and then choose the unit they want to convert to from a sub-menu. The program then uses a switch statement to perform the appropriate conversion and output the result.
#
If the user selects weight, they are prompted to enter a value in kilograms and then choose the unit they want to convert to from a sub-menu. The program again uses a switch statement to perform the appropriate conversion and output the result.
# 
If the user selects temperature, they are prompted to enter a value in Celsius and then choose the unit they want to convert to from a sub-menu. The program once again uses a switch statement to perform the appropriate conversion and output the result.
# Conclusion
The code is written in C++ programming language and can be compiled using any C++ compiler.
